        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the bacon over low heat. Once the bacon is cooked, set aside
                on a paper towel lined plate. Chop once cooled. Reserve 2 tbsp of
                bacon drippings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the reserved bacon drippings and butter to the pot over medium
                heat. Add the diced onions and celery. Toss to coat and soften for
                5-6 mins. Add the garlic, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and
                seasonings. Cook for 1 min.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the flour and cook for 2 mins stirring continuously.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the chicken broth in small splashes, stirring continuously. Add
                the half and half.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the chicken bouillon and add the bay leaf. Add the juice from the
                canned clams to the soup. Stir in the additional clam juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the soup to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 20
                mins, partially covered. Stir occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel and dice the potatoes and add them to the soup. Bring back to a gentle
                bubble and let the potatoes cook for 20-25 mins, until fork tender. Reduce
                heat to low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the clams and let them heat through, about 5 mins. Remove bay leaf.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve and garnish with parsley, black pepper, and chopped bacon.
