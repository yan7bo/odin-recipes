                Cook bacon in pot in an oven at 350 degrees F until
                lightly browned. Remove the bacon from the pot, but
                keep the oil in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the beef with salt and black pepper. Cook the
                beef in the pot until brown on all sides. Set beef
                aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook carrots, onions, garlic for 5 mins until onions
                are lightly browned. Add in salt while cooking.
                Deglaze the bottom of the pot with oil. Add Cognac
                and cook for another 10 mins on medium.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add beef, bacon, wine, and beef broth to the pot. Add
                tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer.
                Cover the pot and place in oven for 1.5-2 hrs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Saute mushrooms with 2 tbsp of butter in skillet until
                soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once stew is finished, remove from oven and add butter,
                flour, peal onions, and mushrooms. Bring to a boil on
                the stovetop and reduce to a simmer. Cover and simmer
                for 30 mins. Skim off fat, remove bay leaves, and season
                with salt and pepper to taste.
